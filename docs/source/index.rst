Power iterations in parallel using MPI documentation
====================================================

Implement a parallel dense matrix and vector format using MPI and
only the C standard library or C++ standard template Library. Implement the power iteration in
parallel to compute an approximation to the largest eigenvalue of the matrix and the corresponding
eigenvector of a left stochastic matrix P induced by a link matrix L.
